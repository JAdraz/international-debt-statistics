## Introduction

In this project, I am going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.

## Goals

I am going to find the answers to questions like: 

1. **What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?**
2. **Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?**
3. **What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?**
